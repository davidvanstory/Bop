# TileSet Setup - COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary
All TileSet setup instructions have been successfully implemented programmatically:

âœ… **Completed Tasks:**
1. Created `resources/` directory for TileSet storage
2. Created `ground_tileset.tres` resource with ground_stone.png atlas and physics collision
3. Updated `level_1.tscn` to reference the external TileSet resource  
4. Painted floor tiles (y=16) and ceiling tiles (y=0) across scrolling width (61 tiles wide)
5. Applied red modulation `Color(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1)` to TileMapLayer following style guide
6. Added Camera2D to player for scrolling functionality
7. Successfully tested tile collision and camera scrolling

## Implementation Details:
- **TileSet Resource**: `resources/ground_tileset.tres` 
  - Uses `ground_stone.png` from `assets/sprites/environment/`
  - 64x64 tile size with rectangular physics collision
  - Proper collision layer (world layer 1) configuration

- **Level Scene**: `scenes/levels/level_1.tscn`
  - TileMapLayer with red modulation for visual consistency
  - 122 tiles painted total (61 ceiling + 61 floor)
  - Scrolling level width of 3840 pixels (60 tiles * 64px)
  - Camera2D attached to player for smooth following

- **Automation**: `scripts/tilemap_painter.gd`
  - Programmatically paints tiles on level load
  - Extends TileMapLayer directly for clean integration
  - Eliminates need for manual tile painting in editor

## Next Steps:
Ready to proceed with **Sub-task 4.2: Add Hazards and Pop Effect** in the development plan.
