bouncing height was controlled by initial spawn position. 
metronome velocity is set by the gravity. higher gravity  = faster movement. 

other params to play with for movement:
gravity scale - seems to make the ball move slow when its oscillating
bounce value - 1 is max. 
damping 
linear damping 
mass
gravity - set to 1400 i think
linear_velocity = Vector2(0, 100)  this is the initial push
