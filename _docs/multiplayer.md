### Multiplayer Approach: From Connection to Gameplay

The best practice is to build the multiplayer flow in this order:
1.  **Establish a Connection:** Can two players even talk to each other?
2.  **Spawn Players:** When a player joins, can they appear in the world on both screens?
3.  **Synchronize Movement:** Do the players move together on both screens?
4.  **Synchronize Game State:** Do shared lives and events work correctly?

### How to Test Multiplayer (Crucial First Step!)

You asked how to test this on one laptop. Godot has a fantastic built-in feature for this.

1.  Go to the top menu in the Godot editor.
2.  Click `Debug` -> `Run Multiple Instances`.
3.  Set it to `2`.

When you now run your project, **two separate game windows will open**. You can use one as the "Host" and the other as the "Client" to test your networking code locally. When you want to test with your friend, they will be the "Client" connecting to your "Host" computer over your home network or the internet.

### Revised & Detailed Game Plan with Cursor Prompts

Here is a more detailed version of your plan, broken into smaller, testable steps with specific prompts.

#### **Phase 5.3a: Creating the "Lobby" and Connection**

**Goal:** Allow one player to host a game and another to join it.

**Tips:** This logic belongs in your UI, specifically `main_menu.tscn`. You'll need to add a few UI elements to handle the IP address.

**Cursor Prompts:**

1.  **To Modify the Main Menu UI:**
    > "Open `scenes/ui/main_menu.tscn`. Below the 'Start Game' button, add an `HBoxContainer`. Inside it, add a `Label` with the text 'IP Address:' and a `LineEdit` node named `IPAddressEdit`. Change the 'Start Game' button's text to 'Host'. Add a new `Button` next to it named `JoinButton` with the text 'Join'."

2.  **To Add Networking Logic to the Menu Script:**
    > "Modify `scripts/ui/main_menu.gd`.
    > 1. Create a new function `_on_host_button_pressed`. Inside, create a server by calling `Multiplayer.create_server(7777)`. Then, connect the multiplayer signal `peer_connected` to a new function, `_on_peer_connected`. Finally, call the function to start the game.
    > 2. Create a new function `_on_join_button_pressed`. Inside, get the text from the `IPAddressEdit` node. Call `Multiplayer.create_client(ip_address, 7777)`.
    > 3. Create the `_on_peer_connected(id)` function. Inside, simply print 'Peer connected: ' + str(id).
    > 4. In `_on_start_button_pressed` (which should now be called something like `start_game()`), after the server is created, call `get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://scenes/levels/level_1.tscn")`. The join button doesn't need to change scene; the server will handle that."

*(**Note:** After this, you should be able to run two instances. One clicks "Host," the other types `127.0.0.1` and clicks "Join." The host's game will start, and you'll see a "Peer connected" message in the host's output log. The client's game will not change scenes yet.)*

#### **Phase 5.3b: Spawning and Synchronizing Players**

**Goal:** Make players appear for everyone and move in sync.

**Tips:** This involves creating a new `NetworkManager` autoload for clarity, using the `MultiplayerSpawner`, and modifying the player's script.

**Cursor Prompts:**

1.  **To Create a Network Manager:**
    > "Create a new script `network_manager.gd` in `scripts/singletons/`. Make it an Autoload in Project Settings called `NetworkManager`. This script will handle spawning players.
    > In `NetworkManager.gd`, create a dictionary to store player info. Create a function `_on_peer_connected(id)` that is connected to the `Multiplayer.peer_connected` signal. Also create a function to handle disconnection."

2.  **To Add the Spawner to the Level:**
    > "Open `scenes/levels/level_1.tscn`. Add a `MultiplayerSpawner` node named `PlayerSpawner`. In its 'Spawnable Scenes' property, add `res://scenes/player/player.tscn`."

3.  **To Spawn Players:**
    > "In `NetworkManager.gd`, when a peer connects (`_on_peer_connected`), call an RPC on all connected clients. This RPC, let's call it `spawn_player`, will take the player's ID as an argument. The `spawn_player` function will call `PlayerSpawner.spawn()` to create a new player instance. The `name` of the new player node should be set to its unique ID."

4.  **To Synchronize Movement:**
    > "Open `scenes/player/player.tscn`. Add a `MultiplayerSynchronizer` node. In its 'Replicated Properties', add the `global_position` and `linear_velocity` of the parent node. Set the server as the authority."

5.  **To Implement Client-Side Prediction:**
    > "Refactor `scripts/player/player.gd`.
    > 1. In `_physics_process`, the `if is_multiplayer_authority():` block should remain. Inside it, after applying local movement, call a new RPC function, `submit_input.rpc_id(1, direction)`.
    > 2. Create the function `submit_input(direction)` and annotate it with `@rpc("any_peer", "reliable")`. This function will run on the server. Inside it, apply the movement logic using the `direction` parameter."

#### **Phase 5.3c: Synchronizing Game State & Collisions**

**Goal:** Ensure players share lives and can collide with each other.

**Cursor Prompts:**

1.  **To Handle Shared Lives:**
    > "Modify `GameState.gd`. The `_on_player_died` function should now only be called on the server. Change the signal emission to an RPC call: `handle_player_death.rpc()`. The `handle_player_death` RPC function, callable by the server on all clients, will contain the logic to decrement lives and check for game over."

2.  **To Enable Player-Player Collision:**
    > "Open `scenes/player/player.tscn`. Select the root `player` node. In the Inspector under `Collision`, find the `Mask` property. Make sure the box for layer 2 ('player') is checked. This will make players aware of other objects on the 'player' layer."

By breaking it down this way, you create a robust system where you first establish the connection, then handle creating the players, then make them move correctly, and finally sync the game rules. This is the professional workflow for building a multiplayer game.
