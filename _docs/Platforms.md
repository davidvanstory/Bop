Creating Reusable Platforms
This follows the exact same "Great Approach" (scene inheritance) that we used for the spikes. It's the cleanest and most powerful way.

Part 1: Create the BasePlatform.tscn Scene
    This scene will contain the shared physics properties for all platforms.
    Create a New Scene: Go to Scene -> New Scene.
    Choose Root Node: Select Other Node and choose StaticBody2D. Rename it to BasePlatform.
    Set Physics Layer: Select the BasePlatform node. In the Inspector, under Collision, set its Layer to world (Layer 1). This ensures the player will bounce off it correctly.
    Save the Scene: Save it as BasePlatform.tscn inside a new folder: scenes/environment/.

Part 2: Create the Reusable WoodPlatform.tscn
    This is the actual, visible block you will place in your levels.
    Create an Inherited Scene: Go to Scene -> New Inherited Scene... and select your newly created BasePlatform.tscn.
    Add Visuals:
    Add a Sprite2D node as a child of BasePlatform.
    Drag the ground_wood.png texture from assets/sprites/environment/ into the Texture slot of the Sprite2D.
    Add Collision:
    Add a CollisionShape2D node as a child of BasePlatform.
    Give it a New RectangleShape2D and resize it to tightly fit the wood sprite.
    Save the Scene: Save this new scene as WoodPlatform.tscn inside scenes/environment/.

Step 3: Create the WoodBlock.tscn
    This will be your general-purpose, square-ish wooden obstacle.
    Create an Inherited Scene: Go to the top menu: Scene -> New Inherited Scene....
    Select the Base: A file dialog will open. Find and select your BasePlatform.tscn from scenes/environment/.
    Add the Visuals:
    Select the BasePlatform root node.
    Add a Sprite2D as a child.
    Drag your ground_wood.png texture into the Texture slot of the Sprite2D.
    Add the Collision Shape:
    Add a CollisionShape2D as another child of BasePlatform.
    Give it a New RectangleShape2D and resize the blue collision box to tightly fit the wood block sprite.
    Save the Scene: Press Cmd+S (or Ctrl+S) and save this scene as WoodBlock.tscn inside your scenes/environment/ folder.

Step 4: Create the WoodPlatformSmall.tscn
    This will be your smaller wooden platform.
    Create another Inherited Scene: Go to Scene -> New Inherited Scene... and again select BasePlatform.tscn.
    Add the Visuals:
    Add a Sprite2D as a child.
    Drag your ground_wood_small.png texture into its Texture slot.
    Add the Collision Shape:
    Add a CollisionShape2D as a child.
    Give it a New RectangleShape2D and resize it to fit this smaller platform sprite.
    Save the Scene: Save this new scene as WoodPlatformSmall.tscn in your scenes/environment/ folder.
