Based on your `SFX` folder, let's create a clear architectural guide for sound in "Bop".

### Core Principles of Sound Architecture

1.  **Centralize Control:** You should be able to control all your sounds from one single place. This makes implementing a volume slider in your settings menu trivial.
2.  **Decouple Logic from Sound:** Your player's code should not be responsible for managing sound files. It should simply say, "I died, play the death sound." It shouldn't know *what* that sound is or how it's played.
3.  **Separate Music and Sound Effects:** Background music and short, one-off sound effects should be treated differently so they can be controlled independently.

### The Best Practice: Create a "SoundManager" Singleton

The standard and most effective way to handle audio in Godot is to create a global "SoundManager." This is a script that is always running in the background (an Autoload) and its only job is to play the correct audio when asked.

Here is how you set it up and the rules to follow:

#### Step 1: Create the SoundManager Scene

1.  Create a new scene. Click `Scene` -> `New Scene`.
2.  Choose a `Node` as the root and rename it to `SoundManager`.
3.  Add two child nodes to `SoundManager`:
    *   An **`AudioStreamPlayer`**, rename it to **`MusicPlayer`**.
    *   Another **`AudioStreamPlayer`**, rename it to **`SfxPlayer`**.

This structure allows you to play long-running music on one player and fire off short sound effects on the other without them interrupting each other.

#### Step 2: Create the SoundManager Script

1.  Select the `SoundManager` root node.
2.  Attach a new script to it called `SoundManager.gd`.
3.  Paste the following code into the script. This code is your rulebook.

```gdscript
# SoundManager.gd

extends Node

# Get references to our audio player nodes in the scene tree.
@onready var music_player = $MusicPlayer
@onready var sfx_player = $SfxPlayer

# --- YOUR SOUND LIBRARY ---
# This dictionary maps a simple name to a preloaded sound file.
# This is the ONLY place you should reference sound file paths.
var sfx_library = {
    "pop": preload("res://SFX/pop.mp3"),
    "bounce": preload("res://SFX/bounce.mp3"),
    "coin": preload("res://SFX/coins.mp3"),
    "success": preload("res://SFX/success.mp3")
}

var music_track = preload("res://SFX/Balloon Escape Factory.mp3")


# --- YOUR RULES / FUNCTIONS ---

# Rule 1: Use this function to play any one-off sound effect.
func play_sfx(sound_name: String):
    # Check if the sound name exists in our library to avoid errors.
    if sfx_library.has(sound_name):
        sfx_player.stream = sfx_library[sound_name]
        sfx_player.play()
    else:
        print("Error: Sound effect not found in library: ", sound_name)

# Rule 2: Use this function to play the background music.
func play_music():
    music_player.stream = music_track
    music_player.play()

# Rule 3: Use this to stop the music (e.g., on a game over screen).
func stop_music():
    music_player.stop()

# Rule 4: Add functions to control volume centrally.
# This is where your settings menu would connect.
func set_master_volume(volume_db: float):
    # Godot's audio buses are controlled in decibels.
    AudioServer.set_bus_volume_db(0, volume_db)

func set_sfx_volume(volume_db: float):
    # You can create custom buses for SFX and Music for finer control.
    # For now, we'll just control the individual players.
    sfx_player.volume_db = volume_db

func set_music_volume(volume_db: float):
    music_player.volume_db = volume_db
```

#### Step 3: Make the SoundManager Global (Autoload)

1.  Go to `Project` -> `Project Settings...`.
2.  Click on the **`Autoload`** tab.
3.  Click the folder icon next to the "Path" text field and select your `SoundManager.tscn` file.
4.  Make sure the "Enable" checkbox is ticked.
5.  Click **"Add"**.

Now, your `SoundManager` will be available everywhere in your code, globally.

### How to Use Your Sound Rules in Your Game Code

Now, instead of adding `AudioStreamPlayer` nodes to your player or coins, you just call the `SoundManager`.

**Example: In your Player's death function:**

```gdscript
# in player.gd

func on_death():
    # The Wrong Way:
    # $MyOwnPopSoundPlayer.play()  # This is hard to manage and control.

    # The Right Way:
    # Just tell the SoundManager what to do. No file paths needed here!
    SoundManager.play_sfx("pop")

    # The player's code is clean. It doesn't know about pop.mp3,
    # it only knows it needs to play the "pop" sound.
    queue_free()
```

**Example: When you collect a coin:**

```gdscript
# in coin.gd

func on_collected():
    SoundManager.play_sfx("coin")
    queue_free()
```

**Example: When the level starts:**

```gdscript
# in level_1.gd

func _ready():
    SoundManager.play_music()
```

By following these rules, if you ever want to change the "pop" sound, you only have to change it in **one place**: the `sfx_library` inside `SoundManager.gd`. If you want to add a volume slider, you just need to connect it to the `set_sfx_volume` and `set_music_volume` functions in your `SoundManager`. Your architecture is now clean, manageable, and ready to scale.
