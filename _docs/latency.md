### **Action Plan: Mitigating Latency in "Bop"**

This is a step-by-step plan to build your multiplayer architecture in a way that actively hides network latency from the players. Follow these instructions in order.

#### **Part 1: Implementing Client-Side Prediction (For a Responsive Player)**

**Goal:** To make the player's own character feel instantly responsive, ignoring network lag.

1.  **Read Local Input First:**
    *   In your `Player.gd` script's `_physics_process` function, create an `if` block that only runs for the player you control: `if is_multiplayer_authority():`.

2.  **Apply Immediate Movement:**
    *   Inside this `if` block, read the keyboard input (e.g., `Input.get_axis("move_left", "move_right")`).
    *   **Immediately** apply force or set the velocity on the player's `RigidBody2D` using this input. This is the "prediction" step. The ball will move on your screen instantly without waiting for the server.

3.  **Create an RPC to Announce Input:**
    *   Create a new function called `submit_player_input(direction)` and mark it with the `@rpc` annotation. This function will announce the player's *intent* to the server.
    *   `@rpc("any_peer", "reliable")`
    *   `func submit_player_input(direction: float):`
        *   `self.horizontal_intent = direction`

4.  **Call the RPC:**
    *   Inside the `if is_multiplayer_authority():` block from Step 1, after you've read the keyboard input, call the RPC to send your input to the server: `submit_player_input.rpc(direction)`.

#### **Part 2: Implementing Server Reconciliation (To Correct Predictions)**

**Goal:** To ensure the game remains synchronized by having the server correct any mistakes made by the client's prediction.

1.  **Process Input on the Server:**
    *   The `submit_player_input` RPC you created will run on the server when a client calls it.
    *   On the server, use the `horizontal_intent` variable set by the RPC to apply movement to its authoritative copy of the player. The server now has the "correct" game state.

2.  **Synchronize Authoritative State:**
    *   Add a `MultiplayerSynchronizer` node as a child of your `Player.tscn`.
    *   In the Inspector for this node, add the `global_position` property to the list of "Replicated Properties."

3.  **Check for and Correct Errors on the Client:**
    *   In your `Player.gd`'s `_physics_process` function (outside the `if is_multiplayer_authority():` block), compare the client's predicted position with the authoritative position being received from the `MultiplayerSynchronizer`.
    *   If the distance between the two positions is larger than a small tolerance (e.g., a few pixels), smoothly move (lerp) or snap the client's player ball to the server's position. This "reconciliation" step corrects any prediction errors and prevents the game from drifting out of sync.

#### **Part 3: Implementing Interpolation (For Smooth Opponents)**

**Goal:** To make other players (the ones you are not controlling) appear to move smoothly across your screen instead of stuttering or teleporting.

1.  **Trust the `MultiplayerSynchronizer`:**
    *   This is the simplest part. For any `Player` instance where `is_multiplayer_authority()` is `false` (i.e., your opponent), you do not need to write any custom movement logic.

2.  **Do Not Apply Manual Movement:**
    *   Ensure your `_physics_process` loop does not apply any velocity or force to these "puppet" nodes.
    *   The `MultiplayerSynchronizer` you configured in Part 2 will automatically receive position updates from the server for these nodes and smoothly interpolate them between their last known position and their new position. This creates the illusion of fluid, real-time movement. Your only job is to let it work.
