Here is a visual style guide for "Bop" based on your project plan and the assets you have gathered.

## Use Export Variables for Everything Visual

        Never hardcode asset file paths in your code. Instead, create a variable for the asset and use the @export keyword.

        Don't build your player, enemies, or power-ups directly in your main level scene. Create a dedicated scene for each reusable object.

        Example
        in player.gd

        @export var player_texture : Texture2D
        @export var pop_sound : AudioStream

        func _ready():
        # The code doesn't know or care what the texture is. It just uses it.
        $Sprite2D.texture = player_texture

        func on_death():
        # The code doesn't care which sound file it's playing.
        $AudioStreamPlayer.stream = pop_sound
        $AudioStreamPlayer.play()

        Example Player.tscn

        RigidBody2D (this is the root, with player.gd script attached)

        Sprite2D (this displays the texture)

        CollisionShape2D (this defines the physics hitbox)

        AudioStreamPlayer (for the pop sound)

## Bop - Visual Style Guide

This document outlines the visual direction for the game "Bop," using the assets available in the project's assets folder.

1. Core Principles

Contrasting Styles: The game will blend realistically textured environment elements (wood, stone) with a clean, glossy player character. This contrast will make the player character stand out clearly against the background.

Color-Coded Surfaces: The primary interactive surfaces (the floor and ceiling the ball bounces between) will be visually distinct. As requested, they will be tinted a calming red color in-engine to create a consistent "lane" for the player.

Clear Visual Hierarchy: Hazards, collectibles, and interactive elements will use bright, distinct visuals to be instantly recognizable to the player.

2. Player Character

The player character is the central focus and should always be easy to see.

Sprite: The player will be represented by player/ball.png.

Death Effect: Upon collision with a hazard, the player sprite will instantly disappear. In its place, the word "Pop!" will appear briefly in a large, playful font before the level restarts or a life is deducted.

Power-Up State: When the player collects a power-up, the ball.png sprite will have its color modulated in-engine for the duration of the effect. For example, blue for "Slow Down," yellow for "Speed Up," etc.
"Pop!" Effect Style: use the font in the font folder for this

3. Environment & Level Design

The world is built from a mix of textured and simple blocks to guide the player.

Main Surfaces (Floor, Ceiling, Walls): The core building blocks of the level will be the textured tiles.

Use environment/ground_stone.png and environment/ground_wood.png as the primary TileSet materials.

In Godot: These floor and ceiling tiles will be modulated to a uniform red color to create the visual "lane." Normal walls will remain their default texture color.

Secret Tunnel Walls: To make secret areas discoverable but not obvious, specific wall sections will use a visually distinct tile.

Asset: Use environment/platformPack_tile034.png (the simple blue block) for these walls.

Implementation: In-engine, this tile will be modulated to a slightly different shade of the main wall's color (e.g., a slightly paler or darker stone/wood color). This creates the "subtle visual difference" required. The player must press against this wall for a moment to trigger entry.

Background: The game background will use background/bg_layer1.png. To add depth, this layer should scroll at a slightly slower speed than the foreground (a parallax effect).

4. Hazards

Hazards must be immediately identifiable as dangerous.

Static Spikes: Spikes will be placed on the floor and ceiling.

Ceiling Spikes: Use the hazards/spike_top.png asset.

Floor Spikes: Use the hazards/spike_bottom.png asset.

Moving Hazards: The rotating blade and moving crusher will need to be created from other assets or a new, simple shape in-engine, as there are no direct sprites for them in the current asset list.

5. Collectibles & Power-ups

These items should be bright, enticing, and feel rewarding to collect.

Golden Coins: The three optional collectibles per level.

Animation: Use the sequence collectibles_and_powerups/gold_1.png, gold_2.png, and gold_3.png in an AnimatedSprite2D to create a spinning coin effect.

Power-ups: All power-up items will float in place with a gentle up-and-down motion (using a Tween or AnimationPlayer) to make them feel dynamic.

Slow Down / Power-up The collectibles_and_powerups/jetpack.png is a perfect visual representation for a power-up that alters the player's vertical movement.

6. Heads-Up Display (HUD) & UI

The HUD should be clean, clear, and provide essential information without cluttering the screen.

Lives Display: The player's remaining lives will be displayed in the top-left corner of the screen.

Asset: Use the ui/lives_coin_bronze.png asset as the icon for a life.

Implementation: Display the icon followed by a number (e.g., "x 3"). This number will be 3 for single-player and 5 for multiplayer.

The secret walls will use a very simple, flat-shaded block (platformPack_tile034.png) while the main environment uses more detailed, textured wood and stone.
