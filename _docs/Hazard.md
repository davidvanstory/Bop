Hazard
    Create a new scene named Spike.tscn in scenes/hazards/. The root should be an Area2D. Add a Sprite2D with the spike_bottom.png texture and a CollisionShape2D. In the Node panel, add this Area2D to a group named 'hazards'

    Use Groups: This is the perfect place to use Godot's "groups" feature. Add your Spike.tscn to a group named "hazards". In your player script, instead of checking if the colliding body's name is "Spike," you can check if it is_in_group("hazards"). This lets you create dozens of different types of hazards later, and your player code won't need to change. I want the hazards to have the effect that when the ball collides (perhaps using a collision effect) then the Ball disappears and is replaced with the death.png for 2 seconds and a "Pop!" font. 
    I want this to ultimately trigger a game-over event. but i think that comes later. 

Collision 
    The Pop Effect: Instead of just showing a label, consider creating a pop_effect.tscn that includes the label and maybe a small particle effect. Then, your player script can simply instance this scene at its location upon death.

    "In player.gd, create a new function _on_body_entered(body: Node). Check if body.is_in_group("hazards"). If true, call a new function handle_death(). Inside handle_death(), call SoundManager.play_sfx("pop"), emit the player_died signal on the GameState singleton, and then call queue_free() to destroy the player object."
